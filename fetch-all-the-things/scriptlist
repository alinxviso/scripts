Collections

These are projects that contain a multitude of fetch scripts / programs. Note that, depending on their intended purpose, some of these might have additional files and/or functionality that goes beyond printing information to stdout. It should still be possible to use them for that, however.

Buried in code

These are projects that contain scripts or pieces of code that can collect information, but aren't necessarily available as individual programs. It should still be possible to extract the relevant pieces of code, or at least use them as reference / inspiration.
