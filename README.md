# Scripts

Some scripts, dwmstatus.sh for example, are tailored for being synced on my systems, so if a script or two don't work, try editing it so it's not system-specific.

These are made so they're in the folder ~/.scripts, with many of the vermaden scripts directly referencing this folder. I'm unsure if I should edit the license text in his scripts to tell if they're modified or something

## DISCLAIMER

I daily a t480 with 2 batteries, so a lot of the scripts are made/modified with that in consideration, i might make some single-battery versions once these are complete, but they'll probably be untested

### To do
Add ipv6 options to the ip-related vermaden scripts

Fix ip scripts so they aren't just placeholders

Find someway to ping with self-signed ssl cert for pinging at school
