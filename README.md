# Scripts

Some scripts, dwmstatus.sh for example, are tailored for being synced on my systems, so if a script or two don't work, try editing it so it's not system-specific.

These are made so they're in the folder ~/.scripts, with many of the vermaden scripts directly referencing this folder. I'm unsure if I should edit the license text in his scripts to tell if they're modified or somethin
